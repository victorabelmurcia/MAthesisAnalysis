<h1>MA Thesis - data and scripts</h1>
<h2>author: Szymon Talaga</h2>

<p>This repository contains every dataset I used and produced for the purpose of my MA thesis research. This of course means that the repo contains the very raw data I gathered directly from the respondents. The only premodification that is not shown is anonimization of the data.</p>

<h3>Research topic</h3>
<p>The main of the study I perforemd was to further develop place theory within social and behavioral sciences. I try to achieve this by attempting to reconcile existing place-theoretical debates with the tradition of ecological psychology (i.e. Gibson) and eco-behavioral science (Roger Barker) as well as the sociological work of Pierre Bourdieu. Furthermore, I reach to some basic results of the sciences of complexty - mainly network science - in order to position place research within the emerging paradigm of the modern science that are extremely well suited for analysis of complicated social and eco-behavioral systems. More info is to be find in the thesis itself and on the webpage dedicated to the project (work in progress).</p>

<h4>Why I published this on GitHub?</h4>
<p>I did it for several reasons:</p>
* To backup and organize my work
* For the sake of reproducibility and open science
* To learn git and GitHub

<p>I will appreciate every kind of constructive feedback and criticism. Moreover I would like to encourage everyone to use the data in order to replicate my results or to conduct their own analyses.</p>
